      <h1 id="info">Three words that define me are curious, tenacious, and diverse.</h1>

      <h1 class="describe">Curious</h1>

      <p class="describe-info"> To me, everyday is a new opportunity to learn and answer the question of "Why?" One of the reasons that I chose economics is for this reason - the field seeks to answer why people, markets, and the world work the way they do.
        By asking why, I can try to eliminate bias and come to a true conclusion of why something works the way it does, then find ways to make the process better.
        For example, at Seneque, I was faced a project where I had to analyse and quantify the opportunity cost of using different keywords in our marketing strategy.
        My boss walked me through what he wanted on Excel, and I simply thought why do it that way? I instead created a script in Python which automated this process
        and was able to spend more time creating a metric to measure opportunity cost, which was the most important part of the project.
      </p>

      <h1 class="describe">Adaptable</h1>

      <p class="describe-info"> I can't do a split, but I would define myself as flexible in my thinking. I keep a schedule and make a list every morning of my tasks for the day, which allows me to be organized and build a
        map for my day. However, plans can constantly change, especially in times of corona, and I am always adapting the schedule, focusing on prioritized tasks and know what to put in the backburner. This skill also stems
        from my time at Fleeting. We scraped our entire application, our plan for the future, and our president, in order to build a stable foundation for growth. This was tough, but by realizing our priorities we stuck
        to our vision, even if that meant we needed to change everything.
      </p>

      <h1 class="describe">Opportunistic</h1>

      <p class="describe-info"> I see every challenge as an opportunity to learn and grow. For example, at Seneque, I was faced a project where I had to analyse and quantify the opportunity cost of using different keywords in our marketing strategy.
        My boss walked me through what he wanted on Excel, and I simply thought why do it that way? I instead created a script in Python which automated this process
