      <h1 id="info"><span style="color:#FF0000">Why product management?</span></h1>

      <h1 id="info">I have had multiple internships at startups at various stages, from stealth to fully-funded. One thing all of these internships had in common was that I worked cross-functional roles including those as a designer, a strategist, and a marketer.
        These experiences broadened my horizons and introduced me to the world of product management, where everyday had a new challenge in store and new problems to solve. This environment is the perfect place for me to apply my creativity and problem solving skills,

      <h1 id="info">Three words that define me are curious, tenacious, and diverse.</h1>

      <h1 class="describe">Curious</h1>

      <p class="describe-info"> I am always thinking about the reasons behind everything, this allows me to examine the root cause for something existing as it is, and find improvements. This train of thought causes me to dive deep into both intriguing and mundane things. For example,
        consider a microwave. It makes a beeping sound to notify that food is ready, yet this sound can be the bane of existence for night owls and other people trying to quietly warm food. Thus, I've always thought that making a silence setting, which each user can
        set personally and activate with one button, would be a value-add for many people.
      </p>

      <h1 class="describe">Tenacious</h1>

      <p class="describe-info"> I am never satisfied with not being my best and while I recognize when I do not know something, I do not give up and instead find the answer. When my friends ask for my help with homework or code, I am always at the ready, however, sometimes I do
        get stumped. In these situations, I admit that I do not know how to help, but follow it up with 'But I will find out'. I do not give up, and treat each failure as an opportunity to learn and recycle the experience in my future endeavors.
      </p>

      <h1 class="describe">Diverse</h1>

      <p class="describe-info"> This word is very ambiguous, but I embody all definitions. I was born in India, raised in Canada, and now have lived in the US for 8 years. Thus, I am diverse in my history, in my experiences, and in the types of
        people I have met. On the other hand, I am also diverse in thought. What I mean by this is that I often extrapolate from my experiences and apply them to a completely different fields. For example, my favorite book is <i>The Art of War</i>
        as I derive the spirit/embodiment of the passages and apply them to product management, instead of war.
