           <div class="subtitle"> As Fleeting was a two-sided marketplace, I beta tested the supply of drivers by advertising an opening on various channels, such as Indeed and LinkedIn, with our highest rate of success being on Indeed. We estimated that 30-40 people would apply and we could reach out to each individual,
             then use the data we would get from such interactions to inform marketing campaigns and build user stories. However, in four days, we recieved applications from 300 people, and realized we had an opportunity to build our pool of potential applicants and leverage it to onboard more trucking companies.
             In the three days following, I collaborated with design and engineering to launch a sign up feature on our site which would put interested parties on a waitlist and save them in our system, giving us a pool of candidates that we could reach out to for data collection and future supply needs.
