          As Fleeting was a two-sided marketplace, I beta tested the supply of drivers by advertising an opening on various channels, such as Indeed and LinkedIn, with our highest rate of success being on Indeed. We estimated that 30-40 people would apply and we could reach out to each individual,
          then use the data we would get from such interactions to inform marketing campaigns and build user stories. However, in four days, we recieved applications from 300 people, and realized we had an opportunity to build our pool of potential applicants and leverage it to onboard more trucking companies.
          In the three days following, I collaborated with design and engineering to launch a sign up feature on our site which would put interested parties on a waitlist and save them in our system, giving us a pool of candidates that we could reach out to for data collection and future supply needs.

        I used the momentum I gained from these initial changes to work with different teams and get a better sense for the product vision as well as product market fit. In this time, working with design, I co-created a marketing flyer campaign and designed a social
        media strategy that is in place today. In addition, I was active in prototyping the MVP and analyzing the business structure of a company. I utilized my data analysis skills to map out the financials of Fleeting as well as where our revenue was being generated from.
        This internal audit led to a restructring of our business model and we shifted to a SaaS based platform. Since then, revenue has continued increasing and we have shifted focs </p>

      Seneque is an international brand based in Geneva that is created a dietary supplement with the main ingredient being NMN. While not a tech role, I jumped at this opportunity because it was a great chance for me to improve my business skills.
      While the company had set its roots back in Europe, the US team was very new, so when I first joined, I began to identify product market fit as well as analyze value add channels we could penetrate by performing a sentiment analysis.
      I went through many online forums and groups to judge such sentiment and found that the

      <p>Over the summer, as I was at home due to Covid-19, I took time to improve my hard skills and better learn how to speak with engineers. I recieved my AI Engineering Specialization Certificate from IBM, which involved completing multiple projects in different
      languages, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Python. Using these languages, I built convoluted neural networks and analyzed the accuracy/use-cases of different classification techniques, such as trees and KNN.</p>

      <p>Other data analysis, my friends and I began to work on creating an app called FoodCheck, which aggregates reviews for restaurants from multiple different sites. Currently, we have an MVP that averages Google Reviews and Yelp stars, but we plan to use NLP to
      sort through user reviews on both those platforms, and assign a score that will not just rely on quantified data. Through this experience, I have increased my knowledge of design and user-flows, while also improving in communicating with engineers.</p>

      To put more emphasis on user designs, I lead team members in Strategic Venture Society in a summer long UX/UI challenge, where we would use an app idea and design it. Through the process, I gained a better understanding of user flows and product design,
      while also learning how to clearly articulate thoughts and ideas, as well as apply constructive critisim to my designs.
