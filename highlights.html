           <div class="subtitle"> As Fleeting was a two-sided marketplace, I beta tested the supply of drivers by advertising an opening on various channels, such as Indeed and LinkedIn. We estimated that 30-40 people would apply and we could reach out to each individual,
             then use the data we got from such interactions to inform marketing campaigns and build user stories. However, in four days, we recieved applications from 300 people, and realized we had an opportunity to build our pool of potential applicants and leverage it to onboard more trucking companies.
             In the three days following, I collaborated with design and engineering to launch a sign up feature on our site which put interested parties on a waitlist and saves them in our system, giving us a pool of candidates that we could reach out to for data collection and future supply needs.
             After this, we emailed, called, and texted different drivers and got a better sense for what they wanted when working a job as well as the pains they faced. This data was very helpful in helping us perfect our driver-side acquisitions as well as what additions we could add to our business
             model in the future.

                For my final project at Seneque, I took on the task of analyzing competitors we would face when introducing our product into the market, including their target audience
                and price for their products. However, I did not believe this data would have enough of an impact on our business model, thus I pushed myself to move beyond the base requirements.
                I began to analyze indirect competitors, those who's supplements were different from ours yet operated in the same space, and for both indirect and direct competitors, I took notes
                of their branding as well as reviews of their products. My presentation on these topics was very beneficial and the branding/marketing for Seneque's US brand, Elevant, used this data
                to establish the niche we wanted to take over and how to organically grow within the space. Beyond this report, I also defined the marketing budget we should use through analysis of the 10Ks
                of our public competitors. This report was instrumental in budgeting for our 5 year plan as marketing is one of our biggest spend.

             <p> Over the summer, I worked towards my AI Engineering Specialization certificate from IBM. Starting with a review of pandas, I developed... to work with more data focused
               languages such as PyTorch and TensorFlow through my coursework and projects. Using these languages, I built convoluted neural networks and analyzed the accuracy/use-cases of
               different classification techniques, such as trees and KNN.

             <p>
               I have been working with UI/UX teams since my first internship but I am always trying to get better by gaining more skills and practicing. This summer, I led members of
               Strategic Venture Society in a summer long UI/UX challenge, where I would find different app ideas, then we would all design the app according to our vision. Through this challenge,
               I was able to better understand user-centered design as I was exposed to many different viewpoints and thoughts regarding design. I supplemented these gains by also going through apps
               and exploring them from a product sense,  keeping track of ease of use and especially keeping in mind repeating patterns through different apps.
