           <div class="subtitle1"> As Fleeting was a two-sided marketplace, I beta tested the supply of drivers by advertising a job opening on various channels, such as Indeed and LinkedIn. We estimated that 30-40 people would apply and we could reach out to each individual,
             then use the data we got from such interactions to inform marketing campaigns and build user stories. However, in four days, we recieved applications from 300 people and realized we had an opportunity to build our pool of potential applicants and leverage it to onboard more trucking companies.
             In the three days following, I collaborated with design and engineering to launch a sign-up feature on our site which put interested truckers on a waitlist and saved them in our system, giving us a pool of candidates that we could reach out to for data collection and future supply needs.
             With the feature in place, we contacted drivers and got a better sense for what they wanted when working a job as well as their painpoints. This data was indispensible in helping us perfect our driver-side acquisition strategy as well as in defining features we would release in the future.

                For my final project at Seneque, I took on the task of analyzing the competitor landscape, looking closely at their business model and target audience. However, I did not believe this
                data would have enough of an impact on defining our acquisition strategy and pricing strategy, thus I pushed myself to move beyond the base requirements.
                I began to analyze 2 different types of competitors: indirect and those who operated in the luxury supplement space but would not affect us. Taking note of their products, positioning, and branding,
                I was able to define their target audience and on how they established themselves as a premium brand. My presentation on these topics was instrumental for Seneque's US brand, Elevant, and we used this data
                to establish the niche we wanted to take over and plan how to organically grow within the space. The research also was key in finding our branding, such as color schemas and jars used.
                Beyond this report, I also defined the marketing budget we should use through analysis of the 10Ks of our public competitors. This report was the guide-stone in budgeting for our 5 year plan as marketing is one of our biggest spends.

             <p> Over the summer, I worked towards my AI Engineering Specialization certificate from IBM. Starting with a review of pandas, I developed my skils in languages like PyTorch and TensorFlow through the coursework and projects.
               Using these languages, I built convoluted neural networks and analyzed the accuracy/use-cases of different classification techniques, such as logisitc regression and KNN.

             <p>
               I have been working with UI/UX teams since my first internship but I am always trying to practice and gain more intuition regarding design. This summer, I led members of
               Strategic Venture Society in a summer long UI/UX challenge. I would find different app ideas and we would all design the app according to our vision. Through this challenge,
               I was able to better understand user-centered design as I was exposed to many different viewpoints and thoughts regarding design. I supplemented these gains by analyzing apps
               from a product sense, keeping track of repeating patterns in different apps and the value propositions for adding differentiating features.
